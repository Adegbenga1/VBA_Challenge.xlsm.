# VBA_Challenge.xlsm.
      Determine whether refactoring  code successfully made the VBA script run faster.
# Overview of Project: 
      This challenege dealt with expansion of  the dataset to include the entire stock market 
      over the last few years which specifies "2017:" and "2018". It used a refractor to         
      loop through all the data at  one time in order to collect the same information from all the sheets in file
      Refractoring the code also enhances the speed and make and increase the efficency of the process by reducing the execution steps and and memory utilized in the coding             process  .
      It is therefore important that  programmers are able to incraese the output efficiency in coding after review.
      
# RESULTS
      The results generated showed[VBA CODE.txt](https://github.com/Adegbenga1/VBA_Challenge.xlsm./files/6797416/VBA.CODE.txt)
      reduced time code in excution process due to improvement in VBA steps .
      Additional time variables that specifies execution periods were linked to yearaValue throug the inpuBox ( yearValue = inputbox(" + yearValue + ").
      Variables that also defined tckerVolume,tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingPrices were included as single data types to enhance efficiency.
      
      The outcomes showed that "All Stocks Analysis" ran at slower rate than "All Stocks Analysis Refactored"
      For the year "2017" , the VBA code ran at 1.453125sconds  and "2018" was at a speed 1.507813 seconds
      An indication that the speed and efficiency were fast and better respectively.

# SUMMARY  
# Detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general 
       This analysis depicts the performance of the stock in 2017 and 2018. It is noteworthy that refactoring code increase the output speed and stock performance over two                consecutive years were viewed in seconds. The time taken for output display will support an instant  decision on investments
       In addition , refactoring will also guaranttee analysis of additional sheets in the file with respect to year ,date and time.
       
      ** Disadvantange** is thhat if there is any error in the VBA it will negatively affect the response time.
      
# Detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
      Advantage : 
      1. Refactored file run faster than the original file and geerats output in seconds
      Disadvantage :
      1. Additional codes are required for effective refactored VBA scripts
      2. Errors in coding and formating can lead to incoorect output and delayed decision making .
